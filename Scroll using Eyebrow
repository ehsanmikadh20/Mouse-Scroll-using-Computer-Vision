Hello there! I made a code in Python for scroll function of mouse by using which we can scroll without using scroll wheel of mouse or scroll button of keyboard. I use Computer Vision library of Python to take input. Now you might have a question that what are we going to use for scrolling instead of mouse or keyboard. Since I use cv2, we are going to use our eyebrow of our face. Sounds awkard and crazy. Yeah I know. i just made it for fun.
